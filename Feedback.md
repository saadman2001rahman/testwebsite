# Project Feedback

## Quality of life
* Organize src folder 
  * Group like functionality e.g. pages and components (made style and component folders)
* Align spacing across files (2 space tabs) (updated settings.json and manually changed a file)

## Clean code
* DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself!
  * Look for ways to reduce errors and duplicate functionality by abstracting common functionality
    * (I'm talking about you *validateValues*)  (made seperate file for this)
* Write a front end test for functionality of your choice
  * [Jest Testing Framework](https://jestjs.io/)  (implemented jest unit testing, need more test cases)
* Abstract local storage access in a way you see fit
